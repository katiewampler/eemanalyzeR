# Down-scaled excitation emission matrices

A subset of water samples run on a Horiba Aqualog for excitation
emission matrices (EEMs). This data includes both the samples and
blanks. Data was loaded using
[`eem_dir_read()`](https://katiewampler.github.io/eemanalyzeR/reference/dir_read.md).
For more details on the format of an eemlist, see the
[eemR::eemR](https://rdrr.io/pkg/eemR/man/eemR-package.html) package.

## Usage

``` r
example_eems
```

## Format

An `eemlist` with eight samples:

- **B1S1ExampleBlankBEM**: Fluorescence measured for a blank of Type 1
  water

- **B1S1ExampleBlankSEM**: Fluorescence measured for a sample of Type 1
  water

- **B1S2ExampleTeaStdBEM**: Fluorescence measured for a blank of Type 1
  water

- **B1S2ExampleTeaStdSEM**: Fluorescence measured for a sample of dilute
  unsweetened tea

- **B1S3ExampleSampleBEM**: Fluorescence measured for a blank of Type 1
  water

- **B1S3ExampleSampleSEM**: Fluorescence measured for a sample of stream
  water from Oregon, USA

- **ManualExampleTeaWaterfallPlotBlank**: Fluorescence measured for a
  blank of Type 1 water

- **ManualExampleTeaWaterfallPlotSample**: Fluorescence measured for a
  sample of dilute unsweetened tea
