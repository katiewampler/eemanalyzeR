# eemanalyzeR: Semi-Automated Processing of Excitation Emission Matrices

Tools for processing and analyzing raw excitation-emission matrices
(EEMs) and absorbance data. Includes functions for data cleaning,
quality assurance, calculation of indices, and generating
visualizations. Builds upon the 'eemR' and 'staRdom' packages to create
a more streamlined and automated workflow that ensures consistent
analysis and simplify the coding required to process the data.
