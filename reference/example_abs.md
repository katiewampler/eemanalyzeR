# Down-scaled absorbance data

A subset of water samples run on a Horiba Aqualog for absorbance. This
data only includes the absorbance data associated with the samples in
[`example_eems()`](https://katiewampler.github.io/eemanalyzeR/reference/example_eems.md).
Data was loaded using
[`abs_dir_read()`](https://katiewampler.github.io/eemanalyzeR/reference/dir_read.md).
For more details on the format of an abslist, see
[`abs_read()`](https://katiewampler.github.io/eemanalyzeR/reference/abs_read.md).

## Usage

``` r
example_abs
```

## Format

An `abslist` with four samples:

- **B1S1ExampleBlankABS**: Absorbance measured for a sample of Type 1
  water

- **B1S2ExampleTeaStdABS**: Absorbance measured for a sample of dilute
  unsweetened tea

- **B1S3ExampleSampleABS**: Absorbance measured for a sample of stream
  water from Oregon, USA

- **ManualExampleTeaAbsSpectraGraphs**: Absorbance measured for a sample
  of dilute unsweetened tea
