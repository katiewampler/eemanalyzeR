Description: Provides tools for processing and analyzing raw excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) data. 
    Includes functions for data cleaning, quality assurance, calculation of indices, and generating visualizations. 
    Builds upon the 'eemR' and 'staRdom' packages to create a more streamlined 
    and automated workflow that ensures consistent analysis and simplify the coding required to process the data.
