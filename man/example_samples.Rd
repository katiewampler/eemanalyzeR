\description{
A subset of water samples run on a Horiba Aqualog for excitation emission matrices (EEMs). This data only includes
the samples associated with the blanks in \link{example_blanks}. Data was loaded using \link[eemR]{eem_read}.
For more details on the format of an eemlist, see the \link[eemR]{eemR} package.
