Context: I have been trying to use the fewsdom package to look at our EEMs data because the package looked interesting. I keep on getting the same errors that basically say that my ABS data has too many rows or that I have undefined columns selected. I have tried my best to replicate the example data that comes with the package and I am not sure what I am doing wrong.
